# Project Background
Culture is an invaluable heritage of our ancestors. Culture is also a national identity that makes us have different characteristics from other countries. One of Indonesia's cultural heritages that are starting to fade and must be preserved is wayang. As the next generation, we are obliged to introduce wayang to future generations and also to the international community. In this modern era, one effective way is to create wayang recognition technology. We take this opportunity as an effort to help preserve Indonesian culture which will be applied with technology. A technology that we named “Dalang” will help us to get to know wayang more deeply starting from its type, area of origin, description, and other information by taking pictures of wayang then "Dalang" will perform classification and display the results of the classification of puppets.
